## Installation:
1. Download the source code.
2. Load Project in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). I use INTELIJ IDEA
3. Connect the project with database. (I use MySQL).
4. Press "Run" button.
5. Go to your Postman.

IMPORTANT for DB connection:
1). Check out "application.yml" file for database information. I put there my DB username: root; DB password: 1234;
2). Put your "username" and "password" for the DB in application.yml file.
